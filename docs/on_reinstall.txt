Some notes for things to be sure of when you reinstall a machine:

Make sure that sshd is running:
systemctl start sshd.service
systemctl enable sshd.service # start service on every system boot

If alt-drag breaks, this should fix it:
gconftool-2 -t str --set /apps/metacity/general/mouse_button_modifier "<alt>"

Except, with mate:
Open dconf-editor, find the setting under /apps/marco/general, and uncheck
"resize-with-right-button".
