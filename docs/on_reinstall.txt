Some notes for things to be sure of when you reinstall a machine:

Make sure that sshd is running:
systemctl start sshd.service
systemctl enable sshd.service # start service on every system boot

If alt-drag breaks, this should fix it:
gconftool-2 -t str --set /apps/metacity/general/mouse_button_modifier "<alt>"

These were the things in clone/ on the laptop that I probably want to put back:
android-sdk-linux
androminion
anyconnect
ducttape?
evilplot
latex-makefile
Zotero?
