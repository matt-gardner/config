To see what's on the dvd:

lsdvd

To get one track at a time:

transcode -i /dev/dvd -x dvd -T2,1,1 -a 0 -y null,ogg -m track1.ogg
transcode -i /dev/dvd -x dvd -T2,2,1 -a 0 -y null,ogg -m track2.ogg

(this came from
http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-rip-dvd-audio-to-mp3-or-ogg.html, and it has
explanations, though they were missing the null before the ogg after -y.  For
some reason ripping straight to mp3 didn't work, but to ogg did.)

Then, converting to mp3 files, simply run

soundconverter

which can be obtained from yum.  It's a GUI that's easy enough to use.
