Command to run tracd:

tracd -e projects -p 8002

This may no longer be needed, because I made an etc directory that holds what I
want to go into /etc.  But this explains what I changed and why, as well as
contains some helpful debug information.

This was what I needed to do to get Trac to work.

Getting Trac 0.12 to work was a bit of a mess, because I had to uninstall Trac
0.11.7, then install 0.12 from source, along with an updated version of the git
plugin, and the account manager.  But it worked eventually.

This is the extra stuff that goes in /etc/trac/trac.ini
