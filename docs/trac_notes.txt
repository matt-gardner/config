This was what I needed to do to get Trac to work.  This is the extra stuff that
goes in /etc/trac/trac.ini

[components]

tracext.git.* = enabled
webadmin.* = enabled
acct_mgr.* = enabled
acct_mgr.htfile.HtDigestStore = enabled
trac.web.auth.loginmodule = disabled

[account-manager]

password_store = HtDigestStore
password_file = /aml/home/mjg82/.trac.htdigest
htdigest_realm = TracDigestRealm

[mainnav]

tickets.href = /report/1

Getting Trac 0.12 to work was a bit of a mess, because I had to uninstall Trac
0.11.7, then install 0.12 from source, along with an updated version of the git
plugin, and the account manager.  But it worked eventually.
