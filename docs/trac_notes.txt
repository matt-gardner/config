Packages that you need to install manually:
git extension (if you have trac version < 1.0)
account manager (sudo easy_install TracAccountManager)

Command to run tracd: tracd -e projects -p 8003

(for some reason, after I installed 0.12 from aptitude and then decided to
install 1.0.1 from source, just running the above command gave me a 'No such
file' error on /usr/bin/tracd, even though `which tracd` gave me
/usr/local/bin/tracd.  Setting up a symlink fixed that problem)

Remember to copy the etc file to /etc

You'll need to be sure /home/mg1/.trac.htdigest exists and has the right info
in it.  Right now it has user matt and my simple password in it.  If you need
to create it, use the command htdigest.  You also need to be sure the user you
create with htdigest has admin permissions in the project databases.  You can
do that with `trac-admin [/path/to/project] permission add [user] ADMIN`.


Other notes:

This may no longer be needed, because I made an etc directory that holds what I
want to go into /etc.  But this explains what I changed and why, as well as
contains some helpful debug information.

This was what I needed to do to get Trac to work.

Getting Trac 0.12 to work was a bit of a mess, because I had to uninstall Trac
0.11.7, then install 0.12 from source, along with an updated version of the git
plugin, and the account manager.  But it worked eventually.

This is the extra stuff that goes in /etc/trac/trac.ini
