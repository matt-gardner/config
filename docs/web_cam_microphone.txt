When we got our webcam, the picture worked just fine but the microphone didn't
do anything.  Turns out that was because the sound driver was trying to use the
"default input device," which was not the USB microphone from the webcam (it
was nothing, because there was no default mic).  So, the way I fixed it was by
installing pavucontrol.  I ran that program and made the USB microphone not a
fallback and the sound card microphone (nonexistant) a fallback.  And that
fixed it.
