I found this page to be helpful in understanding sound:
http://www.seehuhn.de/pages/alsa

The problem I was having was that the default sound card was not working, and I
needed to change the default to card 2 instead of card 0.  I tried doing that
from the GUI, in Preferences > Sound, but that didn't work.  But the page above
showed how to set it with a few lines in a ~/.asoundrc file.  The lines are
these:

defaults.ctl.card 2
defaults.pcm.card 2
defaults.timer.card 2
