Spec on 12/23/2011 (just a rough comparison of what you get now for about the
same price):
case: same as above
motherboard and processor: AMD eight-core or Intel i5 2500K
ram: 16GB (4x4 DDR3)
hard drive: 1TB: $100ish, or 120GB SSD: $128 (there was a flood in Thailand
that steeply raised the prices of hard drives)
monitor: there was a deal the day I looked that had the same monitor as above
at $110.  But generally monitors look to be about $200 for 23".
fan: same as above
