Spec on 4/14/2011:
case: Antec - $50 - $100 (the minuet, which the potatoes have, is about $100)
motherboard: MSi 880GM-E43 - $80
processor: AMD Phenom II Six-Core - $200
ram: Mushkin 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 - $82
hard drive: Hitachi 1TB: $55
monitor: Acer G235HAbd 23" - $150
fan: up to $10

Total: $677



Spec on 12/23/2011 (just a rough comparison of what you get now for about the
same price):
case: same as above
motherboard and processor: AMD eight-core or Intel i5 2500K
ram: 16GB (4x4 DDR3)
hard drive: 1TB: $100ish, or 120GB SSD: $128 (there was a flood in Thailand
that steeply raised the prices of hard drives)
monitor: there was a deal the day I looked that had the same monitor as above
at $110.  But generally monitors look to be about $200 for 23".
fan: same as above

Total: same as above, essentially


Spec on 10/23/2012 (trying to see how much it would cost to replace different
components of our machine):
case: same as above - $50 - $100
processor: AMD Phenom II X4 3.2Ghz - $95
motherboard: ASUS M5A88-M - $100
ram: $30 for 4GB, $40 for 8GB
hard drive: $70 for 500GB, $90ish for 1TB, $100 for 128GB solid state drive
fan: $10ish
power supply: $30 for a cheap one

Total: $465 (no monitor, high end of that listed above)



Spec on 11/30/2012 (looking at building a mid-to-high-end machine, from
scratch):

case: Corsair 200R - $50 ($30 after a rebate)
processor: i5-3570K - $230
motherboard: Z77 chipset motherboard, Gigabyte or ASUS - $130ish
ram: 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1600 G-Skill - $70
hard drive: Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200 RPM - $70
SSD: ADATA 120GB - $90 ($80 after a rebate)
monitor: ASUS VK228H-CSM 21.5" widescreen, webcam+speakers - $160
power supply: Thermaltake TR2 430W - $35 ($25 after rebate)
dvd rom drive: $20
keyboard and mouse: MS ergonomic desktop 7000 - $60 on amazon

Total: $915 (shipping offsets the rebates, I think)
With Windows: add $99 for OEM and $180 for retail (retail not really worth it)

Dell price: $875, but would still need to buy K&M and monitor, adding $190 to
the price; also, this has no SSD, the processor is slightly worse, and there's
a video card.  So it's like, $1155 for a mostly equivalent system from Dell,
compared to $1014ish building it yourself.
