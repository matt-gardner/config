To mount a logical volume (like, say, if you need to take a disk that has a
standard fedora install and stick it in another machine to get data out, for
instance):

make sure that package lvm2 is installed

run:
pvs

this will tell you the name of the volume group (in recent (2012) versions of
fedora, this looks like vg_hostname, generally).  It's the second column of the
output, the VG column

run (as root):
lvdisplay /dev/[volume group name]
(example: lvdisplay /dev/vg_soncek)

This will tell you the different logical volumes in the volume group.  One of
them will be a home directory.  In fedora, this is just lv_home, and you can
probably skip this step.

Now you need to make the volume group active.  Run:
vgchange vg_soncek -a y

Now mount the volume:
mount /dev/vg_soncek/lv_home /mnt
